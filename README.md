## Dear Jacky
Dear Jacky is an Android and smartwatch application and a digital companion. Tell Jacky how you're feeling throughout the day so you can record your emotional fluctuations, reflect on your moods, and better respond to any emotional distress.

## Features
# RECORD
* Record your current mood on your smartwatch. Choose from four different moods!
** Select the intensity of your mood from a scale of 1 to 5.
** Use voice dictation to add a note.
* On your phone, you can go back to edit past moods or add past moods that you have listed.
# REFLECT
* See your past moods with a timeline view. Scroll through to see your past moods for each day.
* There is also a month view where you can see the strongest emotion you felt for each day. (Each mood corresponds to a different color.)
# RESPOND
* Using Natural Language Processing, Jacky offers suggestions on how to make yourself happy again based on your past entries that have put you in a good mood.
* Call your starred contacts straight from the application, because talking to a friend can help!
